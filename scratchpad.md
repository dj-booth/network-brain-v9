2. Database Schema Enhancement
   - Design introduction_contexts table
   - Design introduction_skips table
   - Design introduction_history table
   - Create migration files
   - Add necessary indexes and relationships

3. Base Types & Interfaces
   - Define TypeScript interfaces for new data structures
   - Create types for skip reasons enum
   - Define introduction context types
   - Setup type guards and utilities

4. Core Recommendation Logic
   - Implement base vector embedding system
   - Create initial scoring algorithm
   - Setup OpenAI integration for semantic matching
   - Build basic recommendation pipeline

5. Context Layer Implementation
   - Create context storage system
   - Implement context retrieval methods
   - Build context update mechanisms
   - Add context to recommendation scoring

6. Skip System Development
   - Create skip reason collection UI

   - Build skip reason interface
   - Implement feedback collection UI
   - Add context display in introduction flow

9. Testing & Validation
   - Create test data sets
   - Implement unit tests
   - Add integration tests
   - Create validation metrics

10. Monitoring & Refinement
    - Setup performance monitoring
    - Implement feedback tracking
    - Create success metrics
    - Build refinement pipeline

## Progress Tracking
- [x] Current Phase: Setup & Planning
- [x] Current Task: Review existing schema and data structures
- [ ] Next Up: Map out new data requirements

## Notes & Decisions
### Setup & Planning Phase
- Created scratchpad.md as central project tracking document
- Organized project into 10 distinct phases with clear deliverables
- Established tracking system for progress, decisions, and blockers
- Initial focus will be on understanding existing data structures before making schema changes

### Current Schema Analysis
- Introduction data is currently stored in the people table
- Two main arrays store introduction data:
  - intros_sought: JSONB array storing desired introductions
  - reasons_to_introduce: JSONB array storing reasons for introductions
- Each array entry contains:
  - title: string
  - description: string
- Recent migration (015) simplified the structure to use text columns
- No dedicated tables for tracking introduction history or skip patterns
- No existing context storage mechanism

### Identified Schema Gaps
1. No way to track introduction attempts or outcomes
2. No storage for contextual information about introductions
3. Missing skip reason categorization
4. No historical data for learning system
5. No relationship tracking between introductions

## Questions & Blockers
### Current Phase (Setup & Planning)
- Need to determine optimal structure for context storage (JSONB vs dedicated tables)
- Need to define specific context types we want to track
- Need to establish clear criteria for skip reasons
- Need to determine if we should migrate existing introduction data
- Need to assess current OpenAI integration capabilities

### Technical Considerations
1. How to handle versioning of context data?
2. What indexes will be needed for efficient querying?
3. How to structure the learning feedback loop?
4. What metrics should we track for introduction success?
